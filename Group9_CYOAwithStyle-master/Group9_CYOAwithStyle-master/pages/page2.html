        But you wake again... A new figure stands before
        you, bound in chains. He is larger than the three
        from before, and he does not show his face. He tells
        you he can resurrect you, under the condition that
        you pledge allegiance. Under his command, you will
        find others to work in his name, building a group of
        followers to help him regain his power and freedom.
        In exchange for your life, you are to lead a cult.
