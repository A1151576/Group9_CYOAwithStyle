        <h1>Resurrection</h1>
        <p>But you wake again... A new figure stands before
            you, bound in chains. He is larger than the three
            from before, and he does not show his face. He tells
            you he can resurrect you, under the condition that
            you pledge allegiance. Under his command, you will
            find others to work in his name, building a group of
            followers to help him regain his power and freedom.
            In exchange for your life, you are to lead a cult.
