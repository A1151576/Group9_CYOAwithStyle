      <h1>The Cult Maker</h1>
      <p>With the aid of your new master, you rise again,
        back in the blood-splattered pentagram. You
        defeat the followers of the three gods that
        slaughtered you, and they flee, but you will face
        them again someday. You devote your new life to the
        one bound in chains. You find others who have been
        taken captive by the cult that once held you, or are
        otherwise endangered in the harsh wilderness of this
        world, and save them in order to gain new followers.
        As your following grows, so does your power.
      </p>
