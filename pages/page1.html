        <h1>The Pentagram</h1>
        <p>You are a lamb, the last of your kind, all used as sacrifice to
            the three old gods. You've just woken, after a whole life of
            running, captured. You are surrounded by hooded
            creatures holding spears. Other weapons sit at their hips,
            daring you to fight back. They border both sides of a dark
            path. You are forced to follow the trail they line, poked
            and prodded in the direction of a sort of stage, where
            three hulking figures stand. You are pushed into the
            center of a sticky pentagram, and the figures lean over
            you. After a booming speech to their followers, they order
            one forward. A quick movement, and you are slaughtered.
