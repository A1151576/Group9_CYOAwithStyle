    <div class="p1Story">You are a lamb, the last of your kind, all used as sacrifice to
        the three old gods. You've just woken, after a whole life of
        running, captured. You are surrounded by hooded
        creatures holding spears. Other weapons sit at their hips,
        daring you to fight back. They border both sides of a dark
        path. You are forced to follow the trail they line, poked
        and prodded in the direction of a sort of stage, where
        three hulking figures stand. You are pushed into the
        center of a sticky pentagram, and the figures lean over
        you. After a booming speech to their followers, they order
        one forward. A quick movement, and you are slaughtered.</div>
