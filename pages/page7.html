            <h1>The One Who Waits</h1>
            <p>He rises to his full self, his true self. Once again, he asks you to bow. After all this time, you doubt your master. Your followers joined this cult for you, not for this god. While you may have fought under his name, you ponder whether or not you should simply hand over the power you've gained. At the sight of your hesitation, he questions your faith, and more forcefully now, demands that you bow to him.
